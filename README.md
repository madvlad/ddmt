                    Digital Director-Matcher Toolkit

What is it?
-----------

The Digital Director-Matcher Toolkit (DDMT) is a simple and flexible web 
application written mostly in PHP and Javascript. Originally developed as a
class project for an undergraduate Web Application Development course at 
Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, it proved itself usable 
enough to be used for linguistic and psychological research experiments at 
the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. The developers aim for it to be
scalable, portable, and very light-weight.
